# Defines the time the CPU has to be busy in order to switch up

# Generally the kernel sets default values for the sampling rate. For slower
# operations, set higher sampling range values.
# This option is rather for hardware optimization then for powersaving.

# This will lower the target CPU frequency by a specified percent.
# powersave_bias is in units of 0.1%, so it has an effective range of 1
# through 1000, resulting in 0.1% to 100% impact.

# Kernel buffers writes to files that applications perform for a period of

# Read-ahead, in kilobytes. You can spin down the disk while playing
# MP3/OGG by setting the disk readahead to a reasonable size, e.g. 3072 (3
# MB).  Effectively, the disk will read a complete MP3 at once, and will
# then spin down while the MP3/OGG is playing. Don't set this too high,
# because the readahead is applied to _all_ files that are read from disk.
# Kernel default is currenty 128. Good starting point would be a value of
# 3072.
